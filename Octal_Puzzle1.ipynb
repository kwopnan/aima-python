        "This project demonstrated solving the octal puzzle using a-star search with two different heuristics. Further work can be carried out on the octa puzzle to involve solving the puzzle using a-star search informed by better sophisticated heuristic like the version implemented by Hanson et al (1992). An additionally intriguing route for exploration of the octa puzzle could be by training a neural network to solve the puzzle using the starting state as a feature and the sequence of actions as a label. Some graduate attempt by Peterson in 2013 utilized neural networks to attempt to derive a better heuristic which I believe could be adopted for the octa puzzle. I was inspired by resources linked to the textbook Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach by Russell and Norvig. I thoroughly enjoyed developing the octa puzzle solver using search algorithms and am looking forward to greater challenges in artificial intelligence."
